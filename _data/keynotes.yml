  title: 'Performance SLAs for Cloud Data Analytics'
  abstract: "A variety of data analytics systems are available as cloud services today, including Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR), Redshift, Azure's HDInsight, and others. To buy these services, users select and pay for a given cluster configuration: i.e., number and type of service instances. It is well known, however, that users often have difficultly selecting configurations that meet their needs. In this talk, we present our recent work developing the PSLAManager and PerfEnforce systems that together enable users to directly purchase performance levels expressed as runtimes for queries over users' specific datasets.  Given a cloud data analytics service, the PSLAManager generates a database-specific performance-oriented SLA with multiple choices of service tiers. PerfEnforce uses elastic scaling to meet, at a low cost, the SLA runtime guarantees that the user purchases. We present the core algorithms behind each system as well as their evaluation using the Myria cloud data analytics system running on Amazon EC2."
